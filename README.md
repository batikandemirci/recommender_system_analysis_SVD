# Movie Recommendation System with SVD & Data Visualization

## Algorithm Overview

### 1. **Import Required Libraries**
   - Import necessary libraries for data analysis, machine learning, and visualization.
     - **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, surprise (SVD model), etc.
  
### 2. **Load the Data**
   - Load the datasets for movie metadata and user ratings.
     - **Datasets:**
       - `movies_metadata.csv`: Contains metadata for movies (e.g., title, genres, etc.)
       - `ratings_small.csv`: Contains user ratings for movies.

### 3. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Clean and merge the datasets:
     - Convert the movie IDs to numeric format and drop rows with invalid or missing movie IDs.
     - Merge the movie data and ratings data based on movie IDs to create a unified dataset.
     - Extract relevant columns for the recommendation system (e.g., userId, movieId, rating).
  
### 4. **Data Exploration & Visualization (EDA)**
   - **Visualize Movie Genres:**
     - Extract movie genres from the `genres` column and create dummy variables for each genre.
     - Visualize the distribution of movie genres using a bar plot to understand which genres are the most popular.
  
   - **Visualize User Ratings Distribution:**
     - Plot the distribution of ratings given by users using a histogram.
  
   - **Visualize Correlation Between Numeric Features:**
     - Create a heatmap to show correlations between numeric features (e.g., budget, popularity, revenue).
  
   - **Visualize User Rating Behavior:**
     - Scatter plot showing the relationship between the number of ratings and the average rating per user.

### 5. **Prepare Data for Model Training**
   - Filter relevant columns from the dataset for building the recommendation model (userId, movieId, rating).
   - Convert the dataset into a format compatible with the `surprise` library.
   - Define the rating scale for the dataset (0 to 5 scale for ratings).
  
### 6. **Split Data into Training and Test Sets**
   - Split the dataset into a training set (80%) and a test set (20%) using the `train_test_split` method from the `surprise` library.

### 7. **Build the SVD Model**
   - Initialize the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) model from the `surprise` library.
   - Train the SVD model on the training set.
   - Evaluate the model’s performance using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on the test set.
  
### 8. **Generate Recommendations**
   - **Create a Function to Get Top-N Recommendations:**
     - Implement a function to retrieve the top N movie recommendations for a specific user.
     - Sort the predicted ratings for each user and select the top N movies with the highest ratings.
  
   - **Display Recommendations:**
     - For a given user (e.g., userId = 3), get the top N recommended movies.
     - Retrieve the movie titles corresponding to the recommended movie IDs.
     - Display the list of recommended movies to the user.

### 9. **Model Evaluation and Improvement**
   - Evaluate the model’s performance based on the RMSE metric.
   - Potential areas of improvement:
     - Hyperparameter tuning (e.g., adjusting the number of latent factors in the SVD model).
     - Incorporating more features, such as user demographics, movie metadata, or time-based patterns.

### 10. **Conclusion**
   - Summarize the effectiveness of the SVD-based recommendation system.
   - Highlight the use of Seaborn for data exploration and visualization.
   - Discuss the potential to enhance the model with additional techniques or data.

## Final Notes

This algorithm outlines the steps required to create a Movie Recommendation System using SVD, combined with thorough data exploration and visualization. By visualizing the data, we can identify trends and patterns that can inform the recommendation process. The system can be further extended with additional features, different models, or other advanced techniques like deep learning or hybrid models for improved recommendations.
